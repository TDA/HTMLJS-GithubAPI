## My GitHub Contribution graph
* This repo is a set of repos that are going to help me find out which languages I code a lot in.
* True to being a polyglot, I have continued here with JS, switching over from Python/Ruby
* Will be using the D3 library to plot these super cool graphs I am thinking of :D
